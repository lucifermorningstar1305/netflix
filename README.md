## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to analyse the Netflix data and try to deduce a list of relationships and understanding as follows:

* Which actors in a specific country 🇮🇳🇦🇺🇺🇸 has the most movies in Netflix ?
* What's the data-relationship between Actors 👨🏻‍🦱👩🏼‍🦰 and Directors 👨🏼‍🦳? 
* Which movies have the highest ratings in Netflix 📺?
* Is Netflix focusing more on TV-shows 📺 or Movies 📺?

## ⛅ Database used

The beauty of this project blooms :sunflower: out when you integrate it with any Graph Database, in my case I've used Neo4J for this project.
